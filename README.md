**CommandQuest - A Stress Coders Game**

To play the game, run Main.java in src/main/frameworks. Select your desired player name, difficulty you want to play, the length of the adventure you want to experience, and then choose where to start your quest. These prompts will all follow once you run Main.

If you are stuck at any point of the process, type 'help' in the command line to display currently available commands.

This program is a text-based adventure game that is controlled through the command line. 
Encounters with enemies and friendlies, as well as events are randomly generated. Have fun!

**Dependency**: \
Note, to run the game we use Gson, a google JAR package to save and load state. \
You can download it here: https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.google.code.gson/gson/2.8.9/jar \
The Download button is at the top righthand corner. Download the JAR file, not any other. When you run it in IntelliJ, the IDE should automatically recognize your download and use it as source for this dependency. If not, try the following:
- Click File from the toolbar
- Select Project Structure option (CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + S on Windows/Linux, âŒ˜ + ; on Mac OS X)
- Select Modules at the left panel
- Select Dependencies tab
- Select + icon
- Select the JAR (wherever you downloaded it to)
