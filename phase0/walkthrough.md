Scenario: usecases.Throw an entities.Axe! 

This demo is hosted within an usecases.Encounter in the GameCompiler The entities.Player has an entities.Axe (assumption).They type in the “throw axe” commands into the CLI. The compiler checks that “throw” is a valid commands, then uses usecases.Throw to throw the axe.  usecases.Throw checks that ”axe” is an existing entities.Item/ entities.Weapon subclass and  then calls on entities.Weapon of entities.Character  and checks that it is ThrowableObject.  Then usecases.Throw removes entities.Axe from entities.Character through the GameCompiler. The GameConpiler also adds the entities.Weapon to weapons on ground in the usecases.Encounter. The result (successful throw, failed throw, or an error) is then returned back to the GameCompiler and printed back to the user in the CLI.  This is all done within the instantiated encounter in the game compiler.
